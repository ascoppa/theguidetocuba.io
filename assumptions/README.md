Assumptions
===========

By following this book, we'll build a Twitter clone from scratch. In
order to try out the examples of the book, you need to have some
prerequisites installed:

* Ruby 2.0 or newer. You can get the latest Ruby from the
  [Ruby download page](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

* The [Redis](http://redis.io) database. If you haven't yet installed Redis, you can
  follow the instructions in the [Redis download page](http://redis.io/download).

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/), the version control system. You can follow the installation
  instructions at the [Installing Git section of Pro Git](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

**NOTE:** All the code examples have been tested only on OSX and Linux only.
