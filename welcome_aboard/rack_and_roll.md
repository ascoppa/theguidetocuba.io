Rack & Roll!
============

As we mentioned earlier, Cuba is built on top of Rack ... but what is Rack?

Rack allows us to deal with HTTP requests by providing a minimal interface
between webservers supporting Ruby and Ruby frameworks. Without Rack, we
would have to create our own handler to connect a Cuba application with
a web server.
