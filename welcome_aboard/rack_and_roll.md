Rack & Roll!
============

As we mentioned earlier, Cuba is built on top of Rack ... but what is Rack?

Rack allows us to deal with HTTP requests by providing a minimal interface
between webservers supporting Ruby and Ruby frameworks. Without Rack, Cuba
would have to implement its own handler for each web server.
