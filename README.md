The Guide to Cuba
=================

The Guide to Cuba will teach you how to create a Ruby web application from
scratch using [Cuba][cuba]. Cuba is a micro framework written by Michel Martens
([@soveran][soveran]). It is open source, and you can have a look at the
code [here][code].

Some Ruby frameworks can be bloated and offer functionality you don't need.
We'll teach you how to use Cuba together will small and simple Ruby libraries
to customize your stack. By applying this minimalist philosophy you achieve
more flexibility, less complexity and maintainable code.
