What's Cuba?
============

To begin, let's take a moment to answer "what is Cuba?".

Cuba is a web application micro-framework written in Ruby by [Michel Martens](https://github.com/soveran).
It rides on [Rack](http://rack.github.io) so we have the benefits of
middleware, Rack libraries, and a variety of web servers for free.

Cuba is minimalist by design (∼170 lines of code) which makes it faster
compared to other web frameworks. Also, it doesn’t make assumptions about
the "best" way to do things. That gives us the freedom to choose the
proper tools for the job.

Since Cuba doesn’t ship with all the tools we need to create our example
application, this book will also introduce other libraries that share the
same design philosophy. Together, they make web development simple,
understandable and fun.
