# 1. Introduction

The Guide to Cuba will teach you how to create a Ruby web
application from scratch using Cuba. Cuba is a micro framework
written by Michel Martens ([@soveran](https://twitter.com/soveran)).
It is open source, and you can have a look at the code
[here](https://github.com/soveran/cuba).

Some Ruby frameworks can be bloated and offer functionality you don't
need. We'll teach you how to use Cuba together with small and simple Ruby
libraries to customize your stack. By applying this minimalist philosophy
you achieve more flexibility, less complexity and maintainable code.

Here's a list of pages that uses Cuba for inspiration:

- [AT&Tâ€™s M2X](https://m2x.att.com)
- [Educabilia](http://educabilia.com)
- [Open Redis](https://openredis.com)
- [jobs.punchgirls.com](https://jobs.punchgirls.com)
- [Redis homepage](http://redis.io)

# 2. Assumptions

This book is intended for everyone who wants to get started with Cuba.
It's recommended to have some basic knowledge of the Ruby programming
language. If this is the first time you hear about Ruby, we encourage
you to take this tutorial to get up to speed: <http://tryruby.org/>.

In order to try out the examples of the book, you need to have some
prerequisites installed:

* Ruby 2.0 or newer. You can get the latest Ruby from the
  [Ruby download page](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

* The [Redis](http://redis.io) database. If you don't have Redis installed,
  you can follow the instructions in the [Redis download page](http://redis.io/download).

You can find the code examples [here](https://github.com/frodsan/theguidetocuba.io/tree/gh-pages/code).
They have all been tested on OSX and Linux.

# 3. Welcome Aboard

This first chapter focuses on the bare minimum you need to know to work
with Cuba. We'll learn some of the core concepts walking through the
creation of the classical "Hello World" application.

## 3.1. What's Cuba?

Cuba is one of the lightest option when it comes to web development
in Ruby. Here are some core attributes that are worth mentioning:

* It's incredibly small, 174 lines of code. This simplicity by design
  makes Cuba easy to understand and debug, and very stable (no major
  changes since 2012).

* Like most web frameworks in Ruby, Cuba is built on top of Rack, a Ruby
  webserver interface. Because of this, we have the benefits of existing
  libraries and a variety of web servers for free. Don't worry if you don't
  understand what Rack is just yet, we'll discuss it later.

* Cuba does one thing and does it well, handle HTTP requests. This gives us
  the freedom to choose the appropiate tools for the job at hand. This book
  will introduce other libraries that share the same design philosophy.

* It is fast? [Yes, it is](https://github.com/luislavena/bench-micro).

## 3.2. Hello Cuba!

To get started, use the `gem` command to install Cuba:

```no-highlight
$ gem install cuba
```

Now that Cuba is installed, it's easy to create an application. Open
your text editor of preference and create a file called `config.ru` with
the following code:

```ruby
require "cuba"

Cuba.define do
  on root do
    res.write("Hello, Cuba!")
  end
end

run(Cuba)
```

You already have a functional Cuba application! To see it in action, type
`rackup config.ru` in the command line.

![rackup](/img/book/rackup.png)

Now open a browser and navigate to <http://localhost:9292>. It should
show a greeting message as shown below:

![hello](/img/book/hello.png)

> **NOTE:** To stop the web server, hit `Ctrl+C` in the terminal window
where it's running. To verify that the server has stopped you should see
your command prompt cursor again.

## 3.3. Breaking Down the Syntax

Now that we know how to build a minimal application, let's take a deeper
look at the syntax.

First, we load the Cuba gem to access its functionality.

```ruby
require "cuba"
```

Then we see four methods that appear in most Cuba applications:

```ruby
Cuba.define do
  on root do
    res.write("Hello, Cuba!")
  end
end
```

* `define` allows us to create an application through a block.

* `on` executes a given block if the passed conditions evaluate to `true`.

* `root` returns `true` if the accessed path is the root of the
  application (`"/"` or `""`).

* `res` handles the server response. In this case, we use the `write`
  method to set the response body with the greeting message.

Finally, the last line connects our application with Rack.

```ruby
run(Cuba)
```

## 3.4. Rack

As we mentioned earlier, Cuba is built on top of Rack ... but what is Rack?

Rack deals with HTTP requests. It provides a minimal interface between web
servers supporting Ruby and Ruby frameworks. Without Rack, Cuba would have
to implement its own handler for each web server.

![rack](/img/book/rack.png)

To run our **"Hello Cuba!"** application we used `rackup`, one of the tools
that comes with Rack.

To use `rackup`, you need to supply a config file (by convention it uses
the *.ru* extension). This file connects the Rack interface with our
application through the `run` method. This method receives an object that
returns a Rack response. In our case, that object is our Cuba application:

```ruby
run(Cuba)
```

`rackup` also figures out which server you have available. When we
executed `rackup config.ru`, it fired up *WEBrick*, a web server
built into Ruby by default.

```no-highlight
$ rackup config.ru
[2014-05-06 23:37:23] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1
...
```
