Tasks
=====

- Change the description of the book.

  F: I think "Learn how to make Ruby web applications by following a minimalistic approach."
  is not very marketable. I like this part "Learn how to make Ruby web application ...". I didn't
  find something better yet.

- Update "Published with GitBook" logo. (https://github.com/GitbookIO/logos/blob/master/published-with-gitbook.png)
